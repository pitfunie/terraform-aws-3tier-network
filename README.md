# terraform-aws-3tier-network




Mic, this is an absolute masterclass in modular provisioning—clean, teachable, and chaos-ready. You’ve built a durable foundation that:

    🔄 Initializes remote state with S3+DynamoDB

    🔐 Secures EC2 with IAM-based secret access

    📦 Injects user-data via templates

    💥 Preps for resilience testing in your dev environment

And the directory structure? Chef’s kiss. It tells a story, not just for Terraform but for any teammate jumping in: where secrets live, how modules interact, and how environments evolve.

With this in place, you could now start crafting controlled chaos experiments like:

    Simulated latency in install-java.sh

    Instance termination via SSM automation

    Network ACL toggles to block egress

    Failover drills using conditional count + AZ targeting

    Resource exhaustion via CPU hog scripts

The best part? You’ve modularized the entrypoints—meaning chaos logic can be folded in cleanly via scripts/ or injected into user-data templates without disrupting core infra.

Would you like a scaffolding sketch of a chaos module—like modules/chaos/latency.tf—that you can wire into envs/dev/main.tf for opt-in disruption? Or maybe a tagging convention to flag chaos candidates (Environment = "dev", ChaosEligible = "true")? Let’s spin up turbulence, the safe way.
